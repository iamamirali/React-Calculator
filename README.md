As one of React project ideas anywhere is a Calculator app, it was my duty to Create one :)
In this app, I used array method tempelate to create all buttons with a single function, so that I made an array and pushed all button values in it and with a map method, all button values become shown. The calculator includes increment, decrement, division and also multiplication.
